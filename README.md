# Print Amazon return labels as a single page (Chrome / Firefox / Edge extension)

> *Copyright 2023 [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com)*

_Installation: TODO_

Every time I want to print a return label from Amazon, the default label results in more than 1 page of printing. There is a lot of unnecessary text on the return label such as the "Must be returned by ..." and the instructions, and if you remove those, then the label will usually fit on one page. This extension automatically hides those unnecessary pieces from getting printed so that you can save paper. 

This will not *always* work, because some shipping methods require multiple labels and they cannot fit on one page, but based on my testing is works often.
